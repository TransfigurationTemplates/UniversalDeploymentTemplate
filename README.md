Many thanks to the people over @ CloudAlchemy for inspiring this. I had to create some deployment templates that mimic'd their deployments so that they'd fit in with my configuration guidelines for a work project. Because of that I found that I suddenly needed the ability to create these quickly for deploying tools that would normally be deployed with very specific configurations. I personally try to create everything as reusable as possible and thus this project spawned. Use and modify to your liking!
